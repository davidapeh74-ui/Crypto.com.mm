# Educational Scam Simulation Demo – FAKE CRYPTO DASHBOARD

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: THIS IS A FAKE, SIMULATED WEBSITE FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY ⚠️**  
**This repository demonstrates a common cryptocurrency scam design (pig-butchering / fake investment platform).**  
**DO NOT USE THIS TO DECEIVE, PHISH, OR SCAM ANYONE.**  
**Misuse of this content is illegal and unethical. The author is not responsible for any improper use.**

## Purpose
This is a static HTML/CSS demo mimicking scam dashboards often seen in advance-fee crypto frauds (unrealistic high balances, guaranteed daily yields like 1%, VIP levels, fake transaction logs, "Participate Now" buttons, etc.).

It is intended **strictly for**:
- Cybersecurity awareness training
- Anti-scam education (e.g., showing red flags to friends, family, students, or in presentations)
- School projects, security courses, or red-team simulations (with permission)
- Personal learning about how scam UIs trick people

**Never deploy this publicly without massive disclaimers on every page.**  
**Never add real payment/wallet functionality.**  
**Never collect any user data.**

## Red Flags This Demo Highlights
- Unrealistic returns (e.g., 1% daily = 365%+ APY – mathematically unsustainable)
- Massive fake balances and "limits" to build greed/trust
- Pressure tactics ("Participate Now")
- Fake live records and VIP tiers requiring more deposits
- No real regulation, company info, or verifiable team

Real scams like this often lead to loss of funds after initial "profits" are shown.
